1. Import Export(default and name) in ES6 and Module(multiple interconnected functionality)
2. Components(diffrent parts of js code with individual functionality). 
3. Single component render with wrapper tag (<> 1</> , <react.strictmode> 1<react.strictmode/>,<div> 1<div/><fragment> 1<fragment/>.
4. JSX = ability to use normal html in JS file. We can use whole html functionality as JSX but it has to wrapped by 1 wrapper tag.
  -class is a reserved keyword. So, in JSX we use ClassName with camelcase as html class attribute.
5. Single tag has to be closed with self closing tag.
6. We can use direct JS literals(var,func, obj etc) in html with curly braces. ex: <p>{var_Name}<p/>.
