1. Import Export(default and name) in ES6 and Module(multiple interconnected functionality)
2. Components(diffrent parts of js code with individual functionality)example: Header.js , Footer , content etc. 
 - Pros: if needed We can change only acctual component, no need to edit whole file. 
 - Component name must be capital case like Header.jsx 
 - function base and class base components are two type of comp
3. Single component render with wrapper tag (<> 1</> , <react.strictmode> 1<react.strictmode/>,<div> 1<div/><fragment> 1<fragment/>.
4. JSX = ability to use normal html in JS file. We can use whole html functionality as JSX but it has to wrapped by 1 wrapper tag.
  -class is a reserved keyword. So, in JSX we use ClassName with camelcase as html class attribute.
5. Single tag has to be closed with self closing tag.
6. We can use direct JS literals(var,func, obj etc) in html with curly braces. ex: <p>{var_Name}<p/>.
7. Component extension can be .js or .jsx . it's better to use jsx so that editor will understand its a react file.














Code:

1. arrow function: let func_name = () => {func body code and return() func/keyword}
2. [export default func_name;] and [import func_name from "./path"]
3. Path: [./current dir file] [../1 out dir file]

Shorcut command:
1. after creating new components, use [rafce] for it's possible body code.
