1. Import Export(default and name) in ES6 and Module(multiple interconnected functionality).
 - We can use export keyword before function name or at the bottom of the code body.
 -[export default Header & import func_name from "./path"] only 1 default export possible. Again, [export {Header} & import {Header} from "./path"].
 - default comp name will be simple but other comp name will be in curly braces.
2. Components(diffrent parts of js code with individual functionality)example: Header.js , Footer , content etc. 
 - Pros: if needed We can change only acctual component, no need to edit whole file. 
 - Component name must be capital case like Header.jsx 
 - function base and class base components are two type of comp
3. Single component render with wrapper tag (<> 1</> , <react.strictmode> 1<react.strictmode/>,<div> 1<div/><fragment> 1<fragment/>.
4. JSX = ability to use normal html in JS file. We can use whole html functionality as JSX but it has to wrapped by 1 wrapper tag.
  -class is a reserved keyword. So, in JSX we use ClassName with camelcase as html class attribute.
5. Single tag has to be closed with self closing tag.
6. We can use direct JS literals(var,func, obj etc) in html with curly braces. ex: <p>{var_Name}<p/>.
7. Component extension can be .js or .jsx . it's better to use jsx so that editor will understand its a react file.
8. Small case tag name consider as it's own element by jsx but Capital case tag name use as component in jsx.
9. Better to use component folder under src folder for better work.
10. Better to use same name for comp[.jsx] and it's stylesheet[.css].
11. [./inner/fileName] and [../outerFilename/fileName].



CSS:
1. if we import css in any js file and css used there, it will effect all of it's child comp[import child type file] also.
2. [import "./cssfileName].
3. style will override according to last css file.
4. We can use inline css [style={{attribute:value,multiple css style}}]. Attribute has to be in camel case and will be in "value" if string.
5. id can be use normally but className for class.
6. We can also use tailwind or bootstrap with react by installing some pakages.










Code:

1. arrow function: let func_name = () => {func body code and return() func/keyword}
2. [export default func_name;] and [import func_name from "./path"]
3. Path: [./current dir file] [../1 out dir file]
4. component name use in single tag with capital latter.
 - <Component/> can be use in render function as our wish to render in any position of browser body. 

Shorcut command:
1. after creating new components, use [rafce] for it's possible body code.
